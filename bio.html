                Meet Lea M&aacuterquez Peterson
            </h1>
            
            <p>
                Lea comes from a long line of small business owners in Southern 
                Arizona. She is a successful entrepreneur and also helped 
                thousands of small businesses grow while serving as President 
                and CEO of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber.
            </p>
            <p>
                She was appointed to the Arizona Corporation Commission in 
                2019 and then won her statewide election in 2020 to retain 
                the seat. She is honored to be recognized as the first Latina 
                to serve in a statewide public office in the history of 
                Arizona. On the Commission and as the Past Chairwoman, 
                she has fought to keep our utility rates affordable and 
                reliable. She has secured over $40 million dollars in refunds 
                for ratepayers during the global pandemic and supported 
                Arizona's voluntary renewable energy goals. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lea is the only Commissioner based outside of Maricopa County 
                and lives in Tucson with her husband and two children. 
            </p>
